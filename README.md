# Game-OOP-Website
# Description

Welcome to the Game website project.
The project is about game data and a little brief about it.
you can separate the games into six categories.
you can choose any game and get a detail about the game and a short description with a link to show its website. 


# What I have used

- I've used HTML5 ,CSS3 ,bootstrap ,Javascript.
- The website is responsive and suitable for all types of devices like Desktop, Tablet, and phones
- I've used many RestApi :
    - used fetch() method to send a request and receive the data of API.
    - got the JSON data to separate it and use them to show the data on the website page.
 
- I've used the OOP (object-oriented programming) principles in the project.
    - Example:
    - i've created GameData class which will receive the data of each game and show it on the main page of the project.
    - in another function called getGameDataFromApi() I've sent and received the JSON data from Api to send it to another function as a parameter.
    - in the last function gonna receive the response and get from it the data of each game and used gameData class to reveive the data  to separate it into HTML code and show it on the browser page.

- In the end, I will appreciate you for your feedback(Advice) on my project.
